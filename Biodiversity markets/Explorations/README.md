# Biodiversity Market explorations

Looking through the material currently available from DCCEEW it appears that there is insufficient attention
being paid to the data that is required to underpin this market.

The intention from the government is that the market to determine the value of the biodiversity certificates. 
For this, the market requires good information about the biodiversity on the land.  This implies that environmental 
data systems such as the BDR start to play a key role to enable the owners of the certificates to capture and make 
available the data about the biodiversity on the land for the market.
