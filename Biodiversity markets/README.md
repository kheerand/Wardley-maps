# Biodiversity Market

The 2021 State of the Environment Report found a significant investment in conservation and restoration is needed to reverse the decline in Australiaâ€™s environment. Voluntary private sector investment can make a significant contribution.

In September 2022 the Government indicated it will be looking to establish a biodiversity market within Australia.

In this map I am exploring what it means to have a biodiversity market, what the influence points are etc.
