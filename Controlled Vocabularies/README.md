# Controlled Vocabularies

In 2021 my work intersected heavily with the work on FAIR vocabularies.  
This led to my growing interest in vocabularies, aspecially controlled vocabularies.
I facilitated the 2021 workshop [Interoperability for Cross-Domain Research: FAIR Vocabularies](https://ddi-alliance.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DDI4/pages/2681667690/2021+Interoperability+for+Cross-Domain+Research+FAIR+Vocabularies)
in Australia that brought together folks to discuss FAIRification of vocabularies and the governance of them.
The initial map of controlled vocabulary landscape was created during this worksop.

Initial narrative from this can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DD6MHcA9HNfH35n-sAS7tryisNll45LmJy-m3UOjknw/edit?usp=sharing).

## Maps

### Controlled Vocabulary Landscape

This map looks the overall landscape of controlled vocabularies.

### Usage Value Chain

This maps the value chain from the perspective of a user of the controlled vocabulary.

### Map of Vocabulary tooling

This map tooling available for vocabulary management.  It takes the list of tooling compiled during the 2021 Down Under Dagstuhl workshop as input
and maps the level of evolution in these tools.
