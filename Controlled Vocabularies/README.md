# Controlled Vocabularies

In 2021 my work intersected heavily with the work on FAIR vocabularies.  
This led to my growing interest in vocabularies, aspecially controlled vocabularies.
I facilitated the 2021 workshop [Interoperability for Cross-Domain Research: FAIR Vocabularies](https://ddi-alliance.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DDI4/pages/2681667690/2021+Interoperability+for+Cross-Domain+Research+FAIR+Vocabularies)
in Australia that brought together folks to discuss FAIRification of vocabularies and the governance of them.
The initial map of controlled vocabulary landscape was created during this worksop.

Initial narrative from this can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DD6MHcA9HNfH35n-sAS7tryisNll45LmJy-m3UOjknw/edit?usp=sharing).
