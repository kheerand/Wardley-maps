# Current state of Indigenous Data

> As at June 2022

Looking at the discourse that is happening around the place, it is of the type that is in Stage II of evolution where
it is focused around **awareness raising, building capability, construction**.

Another aspect that stands out is that the narrative on open data changes from the idiologies of the *second wave of open data*[[3](#_3)]
to that of the *third wave of open data*[[3](#_3)] when one includes indigenous data concerns.

## Some key issues

Below are a list of key issues that I have noted.  These are not the only issues.  They are the list of ones I've paid attention to.
Maybe there are other ones that are more important or more worthy of immediate attention.

[Collective vs the tribe](#collective-vs-the-tribe)  
[Most indigenous data is held by non-indigenous custodians](#most-indigenous-data-is-held-by-non-indigenous-custodians)


### Collective vs the tribe

One of the key challenges is that the unit of governance in many indigenous peoples is the tribe.  The last 20+ years of data governance 
practices have evolved around the Western values, supporting Western institutions, all of which systematically incorporate Western biases.

### Most indigenous data is held by non-indigenous custodians

Most Indigenous data are held by non-Indigenous governments, institutions, and agencies[[4](#_4)].  Due to history of these, most  have Western 
values and ethics, which are in contrast to indigenous values and ethics and takes away the self-determinitation.

According to Carroll et. al.[[4](#_4)] most indigenous worldviews revolve around 'people' and 'purpose', which is in contrast to the open science
open data movement where data is to be openly shared.

## Comparison of data principles

Caroll et. al.[[4](#_4)] provides a good comparison table of the different focuses of the different data principles.

## Further thoughts

Many of these require paradigm shifts in how we think about data ownership as well as the institutions and institutional structures
required to fully realise this.

It is also likely that the macro level solutions for this requires drawing from the Complex systems and complexity domains where focus on the
sovereignty of the micro-units is retained while collective movement towards a common outcome is coordinated at the macro-level[[5](#_5)].
