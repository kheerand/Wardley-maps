# Taxonomy

Between 2018 and 2020 my work kept bumping into the complexity with taxonomy
and the issues relating to being able to have a reference taxonomy for Australia.

In 2022 my work led to a deeper understanding of the taxonomic discipline.  This map is the result of this work and will continue to evolve as my understanding deepens.

* [Explorations](./Explorations/README.md) - Explorations based on the maps
* [Narratives](./Narratives/README.md) - Narratives I can tell based on the explorations of maps.
