# CORETrust seal and TRUST principles

> As at June 2022

In 2022 RDA working group on CORETrust introduced the TRUST principles.  It is targetted at those
for whom the level of formaility of [CORETrust seal](https://www.coretrustseal.org/) is above what is required,

Considering that we are in the golden age of data repositories, they range across the spectrum of
the evolution axis.  Over the last 5-7 years many repositories have emerged that fit the as-a-service
model.  Yet, there are many that are still at their genesis.

During Genesis and Custom built stages, the usage is contained mostly to a smaller group of users where
trust is likely to be implicit in the relationship between the repository provider and the repository
user.  However, repositories in the 3rd phase would be more broadly used and there is likely to be less
implicit trust between the provider and the user.

At this point the TRUST principles start to become useful to provide trust between the provider and the
user.  As the repository becomes more utility, there is even less direct relationship between the
provider and the user and thus increasingly stronger measures are required to provide the trust between
the two parties.  This is where CORETrust seal comes in to provide this level of trust by incorporating
a thrid party to provide assurance of trust.
